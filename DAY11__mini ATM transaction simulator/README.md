-------------------------------------------------- ALGORITHM FOR DAY 11----------------------------------------------------------
first the standard syntax for a c--program
declare condition,balance = 10000,withdrawl_amount(wa) = 0,amount=0 as integers.
use a do__while loop to write the main body of the program .
use if__else condition in do loop for conditions.
1.deposite money
2.withdrawl.
3.check balance.
4.END THE PROGRAM>
when {while (condition !=4)},end the loop.
when condition = 4.
the end.
-------------------------------------------------LEARNING AND REFLECTION---------------------------------------------------------
LEARNING:
i have learnd how to use the do__while loops and if__else conditions where i can now use them and understand them more proficently.

REFLECTION:
it was kinda annoying for me to write but i got it in the end ,it was fun to write and I learned a lot from this
