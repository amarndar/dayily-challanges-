------------------------------------ ALGORITHM ------------------------------------------
first the standard c program syntax.
declare your ints,and chars etc.
use a do_while loop to make a menue and write the whole program according to the conditions choosen.
make an integer called condition(c).
print and scan the conditions accordion to when condition==1 then execute 1 then samw with 2,3,4,5,6. 7 is for exitig the loop.
for 1 use a for loop and logical operators to scan and calculate and store the data in arrays.
for 2,3,4,5,6 use nested loops and for loops and while loops for every condition and display the calculated values.
